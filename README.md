🚨 CrowdGuardAI V2.0
AI-Powered Smart Crowd Monitoring & Emergency Response System

Preventing stampedes. Saving lives. Enabling intelligent crowd control.

🌍 Problem Statement

Large-scale events, railway stations, stadiums, and festivals face:

❌ Uncontrolled crowd density

❌ Delayed emergency response

❌ No real-time risk visibility

❌ Lack of priority support for vulnerable groups

❌ Manual guard coordination inefficiencies

Traditional surveillance systems only record incidents.
They do not predict, analyze, or prevent them.

💡 Our Solution

CrowdGuardAI is a real-time AI-driven crowd intelligence platform that:

✔ Monitors live crowd density
✔ Detects high-risk zones instantly
✔ Identifies vulnerable priority groups
✔ Assigns guards dynamically
✔ Automates emergency evacuation protocols

All from one centralized smart dashboard.
